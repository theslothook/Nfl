This repo contains code I use to feature engineer and eventually run my Rate of Adjusted Pressure(RAP) Model. 

The feature engineering and post model analysis are written in R while the model itself is written in Python 3.

Note, while the code will work, some of the data is proprietary and thus I cannot add it to this Repo unfortunately.
